# Casting MD: Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Polymer Film Formation via Solvent Evaporation

This repository contains scripts and example files for performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of polymer films using GROMACS. The main focus is to model the **casting process**, i.e., the progressive evaporation of solvent in systems containing polymers such as PVA, PEG, and bioactive compounds like quercetin.

## üöÄ Running the Evaporation Simulation

The evaporation is done in cycles, removing solvent molecules (e.g., water or acetone) that are **above a cutting plane along the Z axis** of the box. This mimics the progressive drying of the system.

### 1. `evaporate.py` ‚Äî Solvent removal script

This Python script uses **MDAnalysis** to identify and remove solvent residues located above a threshold `z` value (defined as a fraction of the box height).

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 evaporate.py in.gro in.top out.gro out.top PLANE
```

- `in.gro` ‚Äî current structure
- `in.top` ‚Äî original topology
- `out.gro` ‚Äî new structure without solvent
- `out.top` ‚Äî new topology with updated solvent count
- `PLANE` ‚Äî fraction of the Z-axis above which solvent will be removed (e.g., 0.9 means z > 90%)

### 2. `run_evaporate_loop_final.sh` ‚Äî Automated evaporation loop

This script runs a **cycle-based simulation**, where in each cycle:
- A short MD simulation is executed (e.g., 1 ns)
- Solvent is removed above the `z` plane
- Structure/topology is updated for the next cycle

**Main settings:**
```bash
SEG_NS=1            # duration of each cycle in ns
CYCLES=20           # total number of evaporation cycles
MDP=md.mdp          # simulation parameters
TOP=film.top        # initial topology
GRO=npt.gro         # initial structure
PYTHON=python3      # Python with MDAnalysis installed
plane=1.00          # height fraction of box for removal
```

**Execution:**
```bash
bash run_evaporate_loop_final.sh
```

At the end, you will have multiple structures `stepN_last.gro` with varying levels of evaporation, suitable for final analysis of the film structure.

## üìÅ Directory Usage

- `mdp/`: includes ready-to-use minimization, NVT/NPT and evaporation MD parameter files.
- `gromos54a7_atb.ff/`: GROMOS 54a7 force field converted from ATB, used for polymers and solvents.
- `scripts/` (in some examples): contains system-specific versions of `evaporate.py`.

## üìå Requirements
